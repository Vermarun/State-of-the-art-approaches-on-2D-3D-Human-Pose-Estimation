# State-of-the-art-approaches on 2D/3D Human Pose Estimation
Given a single RGB image containing one or several persons, 2D/3D Pose Estimation is the task of producing a 2- or 3-dimentional key points that match the spatial position of the depicted person. This repository provides a list of state-of-the-art scientific papers on 2D/3D Human Pose Estimation from RGB images or videos.
